#### [Deployed App](https://evening-ocean-95695.herokuapp.com/)

## Concept
AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes
I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Installation and Usage
1. Install the required modules by typing "npm install" or "npm i" using your code editor terminal; must be at the same level as the package.json.
2. Run the app by typing "node server.js" or "node server."
3. The console log will display " Server listening on: http://localhost:3000 ."
4. You can hold control and click on the address to go directly to the note taker landing page.
5. From the landing page, click "get started," to be re-directed to the user interface.
6. The user then can type the title, note content, and hit the save icon on the upper right (note the icon will only appear after there is content inputted).
8. The user can review the saved notes by clicking the note title populated on the left side of the screen. 
9. If the user is inspired to write another note while reviewing a note, click the pencil in the upper right corner and a new note form will appear.
10. The user can delete specific notes by hitting the delete icon to the right of each note.
